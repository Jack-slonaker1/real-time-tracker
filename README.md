# real-time-tracker
this is a tracker used to track bus routes in boston
only routes 1 and 9 work due to simplicity but can be added easily
to remove the watermark, simply change the google api associated with your account

download all files
load into a folder on vscode
run the bus.html in your browser
enter the route you would like to track
start the app

Future improvements
Fix google api issue to remove watermark
update available routes to include all mbta buses
